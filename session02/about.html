        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Truffles are a type of fungus that grow underground, usually near the roots of certain trees like oak, hazel,
            and pine. They belong to a group called ectomycorrhizal fungi, which form a special partnership with trees.
            The fungi help the tree absorb water and nutrients from the soil, and in return, the tree provides the fungi
            with sugars from photosynthesis. This relationship is important for healthy forests, and truffles are also
            valuable because they are rare and used in cooking for their strong aroma and flavor.</p>

        <p>
            Truffles are considered one of the most expensive and luxurious ingredients in cooking because of their
            strong aroma and unique flavor. They are often used in small amounts since their scent is very powerful and
            can completely transform a dish.</p>
