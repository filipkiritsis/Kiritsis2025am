                <h2>CLUB FOUNDED: 1878</h2>
                <p>Manchester United was founded in 1878 by railway workers from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
                    depot, who named it Newton Heath LYR Football Club. The club later faced financial difficulties and
                    was saved by a group of local businessmen, led by brewery owner John Henry Davies, who invested in
                    the team, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902, and moved it to Old Trafford in 1910.</p>

                <h2>MUNICH AIR DISASTER: 1958</h2>
                <p>The Munich air disaster occurred on 6 February 1958, when British European Airways Flight 609 crashed
                    on its third attempt to take off at Munich-Riem Airport in Munich, West Germany. The aircraft was
                    carrying the Manchester United football team, nicknamed the “Busby Babes”, along with supporters and
                    journalists. There were 44 people on board, 20 of whom died at the scene. The injured, some
                    unconscious, were taken to Munich's Rechts der Isar Hospital, where three more died, resulting in 23
                    fatalities, with 21 survivors.</p>

                <h2>TREBLE: 1999</h2>
                <p>Manchester United won “the Treble” in the 1998-99 season, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and
                    UEFA Champions League in a single season, the first English club to achieve this feat under Sir Alex
                    Ferguson. The Champions League final against Bayern Munich was a famous comeback that secured the
                    title.</p>
