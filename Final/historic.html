                <p>
                    Before watches existed, people used sundials, water clocks, and hourglasses.
                    These tools helped people track time, but they were not always easy to use or accurate.

                <h2>The 14th Century</h2>
                <p>
                    The verge and foliot escapement, invented around 1275, was one of the most important early
                    developments in clock history. It helped control the movement of early mechanical clocks.
                    The system allowed the clock wheel to move one step at a time, but it still was not very accurate.
                    Early mechanical clocks often had to be reset using a sundial.

                    Fun fact: Early mechanical clocks could drift a lot, so people often checked them against a sundial.

                <h2>Modern Watches</h2>
                <p>
                    Over time, watches became smaller and more accurate. Today, there are mechanical watches,
                    automatic watches, and quartz watches. People wear watches for both function and style. People also
                    collect watches creating a huge demand for luxary within the niche. Luxuray watches start at around
                    3-5 thousand dollars and can range up to millions dollars! The most expensive watch is the Graff
                    Diamonds Hallucination, valued at around $55 million, a unique creation featuring numerous colored
                    diamonds.
