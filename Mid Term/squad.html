                <h2>BRUNO FERNANDES</h2>
                <p>Captain. Creative attacking midfielder known for assists, vision, leadership and set pieces. After
                    rising through youth football in Portugal and playing in Italy, Fernandes returned to Portugal with
                    Sporting CP where he established himself as a top attacking midfielder. In January 2020 he signed
                    for Manchester United and quickly became one of the club’s key playmakers, known for his
                    goal-scoring, chance-creation and leadership on the pitch.</p>

                is historically one of the best clubs in England football history but last season they had their worst
                league result in history getting 15th in the Premier League.</p>
